# INTERSECT Bootcamp 2023 - Day 2

This repository is for use by students on Day 2 of the 2023 INTERSECT Bootcamp,
held in Princeton, NJ, July 10-14.

Gary's made some changes here.
This change has me feeling all conflicted.

## Funding

The INTERSECT project is supported by NSF awards [2017424](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2017424)
and [2017259](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2017259).

## Oh no! Conflict!
Got new commits to add!
